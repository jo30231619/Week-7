    <h2>About Flipper’s</h2>
    <p2>Overlooking the backbay waters of Estero Bay while sipping a cold beverage, it’s easy to understand why Flipper’s has been named the “best waterfront restaurant” on the island.  For starters, the open-aired restaurant is one of the only restaurants on the island serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. The casual, laid-back ambiance is one you’d expect from a beach location. What you don’t expect is the exceptional cuisine that comes out of the kitchen during all three meal periods.</p2>
